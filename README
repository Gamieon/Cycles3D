Cycles3D Copyright (C) 2012 Gamieon, Inc.

Cycles3D is a free game built using the Unity development tool (http://unity3d.com/) where players can pilot a futuristic motorcycle in what will hopefully be one of several game modes. It is also an educational project to share with Unity developers and demonstrate the following concepts:

- An experiment in open sourcing a Unity project
- A learning experience in allowing a Unity game to be moddable
- A learning experience in using Unity networking code
- General best practices for Unity game development


CHANGELOG
================================================
2012-01-25 - Initial commit of Cycles3D 2.0.a000

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================
1. If you don't already have a copy of the Unity3D tool,
download it from http://unity3d.com/ 

2. Grab all the files from https://github.com/Gamieon/Cycles3D
and put them into a Cycles3D folder on your computer somewhere.

3. Browse into the Cycles3D folder, and unzip Library.zip into the folder
it's in.

4. Your folder structure should now look something like

Cycles3D
|	|--  Assets
|	|	|--  <more files and folders>
|	|--  Library
|	|	|--  <more files and folders>
|	 <more files and folders>

5. Open Unity.

6. Go to File => Open Project => Open Other and browse to the Cycles3D folder you created.

It should work out of the box. (Last tested with Unity 3.4.2f2)


FAQ
================================================
*** 2012-01-25  ***

Q: Where is the glow effect?

A: The glow effect is only available on professional versions of Unity. The necessary scripts will not be made available in this project. If you own a copy of Unity Pro, you may simply apply a glow script to the Main Camera object of the Main and Game scenes. Please contact c.haag@gamieon.com if you would like the glow script parameters.
