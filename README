Q: Where is the glow effect?

A: The glow effect is only available on professional versions of Unity. The necessary scripts will not be made available in this project. If you own a copy of Unity Pro, you may simply apply a glow script to the Main Camera object of the Main and Game scenes. Please contact c.haag@gamieon.com if you would like the glow script parameters.
